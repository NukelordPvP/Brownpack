FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only reduce the client / render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-03-03T15:49:49.763780Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2179725,"followers":3203,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"shfvdKKK","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-03-04T10:40:46.719822Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":986703,"followers":1516,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"m0Dd8Cjy","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+ Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.25","version_number":"1.20-2.25-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T22:37:15.141667Z","downloads":504323,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"21ae6dd81324543e77c10bbb2b928320d71b6750","sha512":"04f017920be9e982c945df0d27ef93a4cace730b7bc6fd46a82c028c50f7d6819ec0a4c28a4454bc681b4591eeddb08b74c330cb577d7a697a2391fcc11d925d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar","primary":true,"size":77342,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"3bb877f7683b45ff74c5e507aa3c3d263ca3b898eaef58f39c7681cff26cc8a34fbdabb65e9ad46b72c001b2cc8293dc7e02f9f6e26399e008ba4f85833ebebb","sha1":"a54dee75a5447fe29ab0d1b9f2f6a64c9531337f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/m0Dd8Cjy/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65191,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.25.jar"},"mods\\WorldEditCUI-1.20.3+01.jar":{"sha512":"7d1dee100a1106c99716f56e09e27f65510f2346bb436481bc45620c693348f8bc8661a8b0143fe335d9930525dbcdd8369dcb34f08b9d6962856bbfab0307e6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"NSLJJooQ","slug":"worldedit-cui","project_type":"mod","team":"7qQORuZ5","title":"WorldEdit CUI","description":"WorldEdit CUI is a graphical user interface for WorldEdit, designed to assist in using WorldEdit and prevent accidental errors.","body":"\n\nA graphical user interface for [WorldEdit].

issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/BVengo/sound-controller.svg)\n\nWe've all dealt with that loud portal before, or those ridiculously loud mob farms. Have you ever wanted to fine-tune just a single sound without needing to change the entire category?\n\nSound Controller is a fabric mod providing complete control over the sounds played in the game. It simply adds an extra button to your sound settings, providing you with a screen full of sound sliders.\n\nBy utilising the minecraft registry, this mod should also include all other sounds added to the game by your favourite mods.\n\nThis mod is available on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/BVengo/sound-controller), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sound-controller), and [Modrinth](https://www.modrinth.com/mod/sound-controller).\n\n## Dependencies\nThis mod optionally provides support for ModMenu, however the settings have been set up to be accessed via the normal Minecraft settings.\n\n## Contributing\nContributions and suggestions are always welcome! Please limit all issues to only one feature at a time - feel free to open multiple at once if you have many ideas. Similarly, please limit pull requests to a single feature at a time and try to follow the existing code style.\n\n\nTo further discuss or get notifications of new updates, check out my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kUhf3WSSfv).

Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine?

Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

It is not affiliated with me and causes critical untrackable bugs/crashes.\n\n<p>Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the <strong>aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft</strong>, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen.

For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>.

Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option. This enables you to set a single global waypoint for a large area/region and multiple local ones in the area/region. Only the global waypoints will be visible when you are beyond the maximum draw distance.</li>\n<li><strong>Waypoint sets.</strong>&nbsp;You can organize your waypoints by sorting them into sets.

The default settings are meant for finding mob-spawnable blocks. You can use it for any purpose.</li>\n<li>Multi-world detection in multiplayer. If you install the minimap mod on the server side in addition to the client side, each server world should get a separate waypoints \"sub-world\". Otherwise a much less reliable world separation is used, which is based on the world spawnpoint. If you can't install the mod on the server side, it is recommended to turn off multi-world detection for servers that only have a single \"world\".

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode and/or entity radar on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;n&sect;o&sect;m&sect;i&sect;n&sect;i&sect;m&sect;a&sect;p</strong> - disables the minimap completely</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Contains most of the common/shared code of masa's client mods, and adds some inter-operation support between the dependent mods.","body":"# Description\n\nMaLiLib is a library mod for client-side mods, containing most of the shared code between the dependent mods.\nFor example it contains all the configuration options and serialization, a powerful keybind system, most of the Screen/GUI code and a bunch of other miscellaneous utility classes and methods for the mods that are built around MaLiLib.\n\n(The name is short for `masa's Litemod Library` because I have zero imagination...\nThe mod was initially created for the 1.12.x LiteLoader versions of masa's client mods.)\n\n## Mods that require MaLiLib\n\nMaLiLib is required by all of [masa's](https://modrinth.com/user/masa) client-side mods, starting from the indicated versions:\n* [Item Scroller](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-scroller/) - 0.14.0 and later\n* [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica/) - for any builds starting from around 2018-06-11\n* [MiniHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud/) - 0.17.0 and later\n* [TellMe](https://modrinth.com/mod/tellme/) - 0.6.1 and later\n* [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo/) - 0.8.0 and later\n\nThere are also a number of other client-side mods by other authors that are built around MaLiLib. The mod project/description usually indicates which mod(s) are required as a dependency.\n\n## Mod Versions\n\n**Make sure to download the correct mod version for your Minecraft version and mod loader from the Versions page!!**\n\n**Note:** There are both Fabric and Forge versions of the mod! Look at the tagged mod loader or the file name to get the correct version of the mod for your mod loader!\n\nThe file name always indicates the mod loader (for example Fabric vs. Forge) and the Minecraft version.\nThe file name is in the format:\n`malilib-<mod loader>-<MC version>-<mod version>.jar`\n\nFor example:\n`malilib-fabric-1.19.2-0.13.0.jar`\n\nThe required version of malilib for each mod version *may be* indicated in the changelog of each of the dependent mods.  But basically you want to get the version of all the mods that were the latest released version at the given time, to avoid version mismatches.\n\nThis would mostly become more tricky to figure out if you for some reason want to use certain older mod versions than the latest available version for a given MC version. Especially the 0.9.x and 0.10.x version era of MaLiLib for MC 1.12.2 and 1.14.x and 1.15.x (and maybe also 1.16.x still?) were kinda volatile for version compatibility. Also the releases based on the code rewrites, starting from MaLiLib 0.50.0 and going until the eventual 1.0.0 release change lots of things between versions, so getting all the mods from the same release date is crucial.","published":"2022-11-13T10:42:15.245705Z","updated":"2024-02-10T18:22:27.194234Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":167132,"followers":238,"categories":["library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13.2","19w03c","1.14","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","19w36a","19w37a","19w38b","19w39a","19w40a","19w41a","19w44a","19w46b","1.15-pre1","1.15-pre3","1.15-pre4","1.15-pre6","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","20w06a","20w09a","20w10a","20w11a","20w12a","20w13a","20w14a","20w15a","20w16a","20w17a","20w18a","20w19a","20w20b","20w21a","20w22a","1.16-pre2","1.16-pre3","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","20w45a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5","21w05a","21w08b","21w13a","21w14a","21w18a","1.17-pre4","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","23w43b","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","liteloader","rift"],"versions":["xpR792B4","JOreljE2","GqJQjBaQ","pfIN0DE8","pEa77F0R","Kp1bn8Wo","DCEIIABn","eIuMPvKJ","tK3R1pP4","lnocmCI9","246Md9Ry","fOcHRevV","vgDmDfUm","Pu8xDtD1","ihvy9Q0Z","9EvFBimR","t8w76VqA","T1D4pEXT","YMIHZNjh","Euau0Egw","aCnJJxNJ","SKRFcsuu","sJ0vpGQ4","YCivjDgJ","T88fw3Go","vVcrJUjW","DQfN3nYw","aCdCLN9a","CLKlpHV8","eJs5BPcy","KBXbvUn5","glNpS49Q","nzayf0vT","AUMrKDpf","WkYufsBv","65EmNeSo","OA4srdXJ","oLSTbZXM","s2hC3mPG","SZbR4R54","Kspglts1","8tPQJhzV","2GXVNzhO","jwGlbCV3","EWs7FsDt","dBC9mwZ1","jMXcLH4A","xoL5eTJX","jzx8nfNF","TQqYSRpR","c4s7Zbz0","xDXYECLH","VBJVQr5k","Orgcteld","fpvuC4rF","j62IqVv1","xl3PIS2V","vDRdBvPr","GNZ1QcVs","9iSCpGAD","PanSzHVC","m4tKAdNx","CnyXjyOO","RFbJZzkP","3LX4TUEJ","brInzMZZ","re5ZP4ae","X8dJ9Bm8","SK74oJ3F","sLRwmtuK","4R0Gqncy","eRgu51VW","LOw3JVMo","AzlkNP6K","UReSBF4h","c7Fc4I7I","dR5rKVuL","Est0iV5r","unSNMf00","pQ04F8DK","M7H0THrh","UCs9tZPz","Z1z9d50i","g4mrp8Tw","mEKA79TO","NFLeefSE","rJuXJGbq","K9lL5sH3","lYJ3YGWO","adfbrE2r","MZ6YndxD","Q0t4XYBi","ofNjwck3","wbnzY76g","EKNDFW3Q","f02CW9Kn","IUSVeYEl","GGSCI6GP","1YdqB4Pt","aJFx8KWb","CDu87Ijx","ujZacei2","tP8wyMQb","RXunrjdh","JirOpckS","tHyxpoOI","BU2oeYjc","irVc8BCb","u2QfMTCe","PnnSBGlW","dWbSJQho","HiREfjem","dCJFeJSY","xvOB7EFh","SdX6LDeV","g7hz9tre","1h3OFjd5","flsBPpIL","dDzb9CtH","rOAuJf39","whn2i70Z","ChcwwPSb","GiLoOI8a","QDVOYcD0","m1uCj5FB","ROauLEoP","4sESRgiU","Gis19l54","SjGToM73","y7pWcuvN","zR6Y2P53","lUVomngZ","KT0odK2H","t9ow8DR1","Caa4rpKg","5ZOdZvFB","h3zHTglb","mpWdNRn1","SEgBLVXp","CSZC7Kg8","nVIcj6u9","AXxe1CWD","RB9rCbDS","LXxCKsbO","LUDJmeQ8","EJD0sMRf","ONcFAEMd","5dBlHNPp","sEdTPERW","n3rSKTxi","SB7tiPti","8dni8zmd","zVs7aEp7","iQzeIzoA","CsKg2NQk","goJg4U99","yn5ciBxa","bie47ObU","yXQKbbFN","7U8phHVA","tmL1GaA0","f7KQvBvd","1lxRNCyB","QscKmQ2D","YVnURsNX","54cA6VvF","zKgKuVqX","N37PPlGv","2lJvqczS","cm5bRnBe","8teYoIPA","5oaVbc3m","BYZbkbtD","deIiheQG","dBwOdoCw","IQkidUS4","Ylo1pzZT","6PDV12GO","cHOCOOv8","Uxcq4Jeh","5AHE21Q9","EKza0MGW","rEDRUNoN","WuABs62s","2nS83Qf7","5SAYCyFk","IjPDJthB","xENxlGYG","pfVHXuBE","jBH9KX9D","Afp8AWEJ","isJt6rth","KfknnBMq","Lav6afIY","HljUtdhE","LhSZt6EF","C5EHWwTF","IY24B9AK","gxgIbzfz","PbcpAEvc","O2DJgzRi","o0AtO0eq","Frx9MtJc","ym1OdFaV","Bg19XPU7","QXOpZ38S","HXSuzGfa","V21ryIsV","Tcv1nnVY","ForaIThv","xVVI2sNr","AJhIEGVJ","dQTgVbDe","WHsimdn0","FYMVqf2J","o041qH7e","AxTFzVcz","M3rtbAPE","3zGlToR7","HXBBAweZ","vEQ2PjZV","HQXz1vnM","k7Vm0Wka","jYVl3riT","GnPJLycX","OEchuJwf","qOW15k2e","V7yLDtJV","wzI0QkCv","YUdoXvUT","66WY7ZfT","ZeB749FP","kZJWQDi6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GcWjdA9I/a530ae55df5e0c405f5cf1b3e4fd6163a398bdc3.png"},"version":{"id":"kZJWQDi6","project_id":"GcWjdA9I","author_id":"yduuH4WA","featured":false,"name":"0.18.1","version_number":"0.18.1","changelog":"-

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

The viewer can also apply deobfuscation mappings.\n\nIt works by sampling statistical data about the systems activity, and constructing a call graph based on this data. The call graph is then displayed in an online viewer for further analysis by the user.\n\nThere are two different profiler engines:\n* Native `AsyncGetCallTrace` + `perf_events` - uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/jvm-profiling-tools/async-profiler) (*only available on Linux x86_64 systems*)\n* Built-in Java `ThreadMXBean` - an improved version of the popular [WarmRoast profiler](https://github.com/sk89q/WarmRoast) by sk89q.\n\n### ⚡ Memory Inspection\n\nspark includes a number of tools which are useful for diagnosing memory issues with a server.\n\n* **Heap Summary** - take & analyse a basic snapshot of the servers memory\n  * A simple view of the JVM's heap, see memory usage and instance counts for each class\n  * Not intended to be a full replacement of proper memory analysis tools. (see below)\n* **Heap Dump** - take a full (HPROF) snapshot of the servers memory\n  * Dumps (& optionally compresses) a full snapshot of JVM's heap.\n  * This snapshot can then be inspected using conventional analysis tools.\n* **GC Monitoring** - monitor garbage collection activity on the server\n  * Allows the user to relate GC activity to game server hangs, and easily see how long they are taking & how much memory is being free'd.\n  * Observe frequency/duration of young/old generation garbage collections to inform which GC tuning flags to use\n\n### ⚡ Server Health Reporting\n\nspark can report a number of metrics summarising the servers overall health.\n\nThese metrics include:\n\n* **TPS** - ticks per second, to a more accurate degree indicated by the /tps command\n* **Tick Durations** - how long each tick is taking (min, max and average)\n* **CPU Usage** - how much of the CPU is being used by the server process, and by the overall system\n* **Memory Usage** - how much memory is being used by the process\n* **Disk Usage** - how much disk space is free/being used by the system\n\nAs well as providing tick rate averages, spark can also **monitor individual ticks** - sending a report whenever a single tick's duration exceeds a certain threshold. This can be used to identify trends and the nature of performance issues, relative to other system or game events.\n\n## Usage\nTo install, just add the **.jar** file to your mods directory.\n\nInformation about [how to use commands](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/Command-Usage) can be found in the docs.\n\nIf you’d like help analysing a profiling report, or just want to chat, feel free to join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/PAGT2fu).\n\n\n## Guides\nThere are a few small \"guides\" available in the docs, covering the following topics.\n* [The tick loop](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/The-tick-loop)\n* [Finding the cause of lag spikes](https://spark.lucko.me/docs/guides/Finding-lag-spikes)","published":"2021-06-04T13:36:54.735179Z","updated":"2023-12-11T22:48:54.192826Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":668507,"followers":769,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["JdNt7oGW","liwd7pvc","D6L5yWtJ","huGeKmwp","sf2nOVoP","DhT8Y7bB","b3zKGLTS","yysWZODg","eEAJpQea","VkKsarbC","qBdtA5uj","6BEDTXhR","9NSIbttL","JjikdHMk","sYlxF6IX","CWiQ0oM4","xvqXC3WU","X9SnVAPS","jg0K11We","Biivc7P1","g60nhl1v","LVujS26K","6hatB19T","FnKxsd40","mMSAkTm6","3opVno4q","EWTsXhFU","RhyaY2vw","XXMFHMBO","OT1CD9Qj","E5XaSI1N","1K3xO8TS","23U6xkbl","g5rM8xSA","pjW9S4dI","N7JzEApO","1dlOe6ez","XhFbpH8f","VhY9p1RU","GygIHGfW","qyMNf4Pn","oCK984FP","dVHkMOHv","Yp6s4wsw","BeIg1bik","4FXHDE9F","XGW2fviP","h0Z2ObM0","tCU9VuzX","8ZQqfeXy","3FEq2lT7","FeV5OquF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/l6YH9Als/13676ddae142a85998c1c0086cafc30ce2efde80.png"},"version":{"id":"FeV5OquF","project_id":"l6YH9Als","author_id":"iRtG8gdL","featured":true,"name":"1.10.58 (Fabric 1.20.4)","version_number":"1.10.58-fabric","changelog":"This update brings the latest version of spark for Minecraft 1.20.4 to Modrinth.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, it isn't as simple. However, if you can download the server world save and enter the world in singleplayer, then you can pregenerate the world using a method of your choice, relog and then use the \"Convert All Regions\" in the world map settings to convert the whole world save to a multiplayer-compatible map instance saved to <i>XaeroWorldMap->World->null->cm$converted</i>. You can copy/move that map instance folder to your server map instances in the XaeroWorldMap folder.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page. It should cover most cases. Contact me, if it doesn't help.</p>\n\n### How do I prohibit the use of cave mode on my server?\n\n<p>To do that, please install the mod on the server side (requires a Forge/Fabric/Quilt server as of writing this). When you start your server, a new \"common\" config file will be created directly in the server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. Changes require a server restart.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you have the minimap installed, you can include the following strings in a server/system message sent to players (on login), which do the following:</p>\n<p>(requires minimap to work)&nbsp;<strong>&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - causes the minimap to disable cave mode (including world map) and entity radar (fair-play mode)</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o&sect;w&sect;m&sect;n&sect;e&sect;t&sect;h&sect;e&sect;r&sect;i&sect;s&sect;f&sect;a&sect;i&sect;r</strong> - causes world map cave mode to work in the nether despite the minimap being fair-play</p>\n<p><strong>&sect;r&sect;e&sect;s&sect;e&sect;t&sect;x&sect;a&sect;e&sect;r&sect;o</strong> - reset all the system message flags</p>\n\n### How do I let vanilla client players join my server that has the mod installed?\n\n<p>Look for a \"common\" config file directly in your server directory (not the world folder). In the config file, you get multiple options that let you disable certain mod features for your players. One of the options lets you disable the registration of status effects, which is what prevents players from joining. Changes require a server restart. Do the same for the minimap mod.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

Crashy is a crash hosting site designed specifically for Not Enough Crashes and Minecraft crashes in general. \nIt shows crashes in an organized GUI that is easily readable, and has some other nice features.

This fixes not being disconnected from servers.\n### 3.4.4\n- Fixed integrated server crashes not being caught.\n- Fixed state sometimes not being cleaned up properly which could cause the game to infinitely crash.\n### 3.4.3\n- Fixed deobfuscation not working in dedicated servers, courtesy of @Fourmisain!\n### 3.4.2\n- Prevented extreme cases where the crash log could become incredibly large. \n- Fixed the crash screen not showing suspected mods in cases where adding them to the crash log was prevented by conflicting mods.\n### 3.4.1\n- Improved internal error message.\n## 3.4.0\n- Provided many configuration options for uploading the crash logs, see NecConfig.java, thanks to The456Gamer!\n- The config format for uploading crash logs has changed, refer to NecConfig.java for the new format. \n## 3.3.1\n- Fixed mod identification not working.\n- Fixed deobfuscation sometimes not working.\n- Promoted to Release!\n## 3.3.0\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.17, Java 16. \n- Currently buggy, this is a minimum viable alpha release.\n## 3.2.0\n- Added a new option `forceCrashScreen` that will prevent cases in which the game closes with no crash log.

This can be reverted by setting `uploadCrashLogTo` to `DIMDEV_HASTE` in the config.\n- Fixed some GUI bugs in the crash scree\n### 1.2.1\n- Compatibility with [Multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect/files).  \n  Note: Informed Load has yet to publish the compatible version.\n## 1.2.0\n- Compatibility with [Informed

possible. It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2023-10-02T18:16:52.181784Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2224942,"followers":4374,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"JXhQlDZl","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.2","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:59.168385Z","downloads":590344,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e8fde231301571ee75695bcd8ceb69db77192551217d8c65d8587d4f114b241112f06b39f82d84c3a13c98c42be6666a9a207890340413441fbe91237f56fbcf","sha1":"f9eaa5fc75d2747dbe14818dfde04eaf7152ae3c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/JXhQlDZl/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":1050675,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.2.jar"},"shaderpacks\\BSL_v8.2.09p1.zip":{"sha512":"fc215a3941102e02e35fbb7c48ff6eecee2c7923d1dfac770250537fdb4c4e3d883e5011dbdd4ead2e54392950b7be6e66d6da2cec757ffb7a385e41f8e35ffa","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Q1vvjJYV","slug":"bsl-shaders","project_type":"shader","team":"yBO6HNot","title":"BSL Shaders","description":"Shaderpack for Minecraft: Java Edition.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a

when a lava drop lands\n- Adds the ability to configure the rate of drip particle spawning\n- In 1.17+, the sounds for water/lava drips use the Dripstone sounds by default, and there is an option to use the old sounds if desired (like in 1.16)\n\nThis mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.\n\nRequires [Fabric

Block Entities","description":"Reduce FPS lag with block entities, as well as customize them with resource packs","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-11-26T00:58:42.011781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1459149,"followers":2922,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"eIFo7wvq","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":false,"name":"EBE v0.9.1 for 1.20.2","version_number":"0.9.1+1.20.2","changelog":"- Update to 1.20.2\n- Fixed chest/shulker box/bell animations flashing when placed on chunk borders (without Sodium installed)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-26T00:58:48.609016Z","downloads":365362,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7d40ccbc5355602325ad3e633592441a63a3999a","sha512":"c6f2c68254624d3add2645766b5ceb467bba9931d5ef357d0d580352b12ed102ce33818be4ca318e97edb34eeb771672b81725f9aee75114e4eb508c8a05396d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/eIFo7wvq/enhancedblockentities-0.9.1%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9.1+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":492605,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":false},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9.1+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\balm-fabric-1.20.4-9.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"b562afd5dbdacd1ec3945b19a0b9b2c03c3e5d4fb2c0983cd79166db5cc9a76cb3b029fe8bd0d59d4a81187a1e9dd8eab5917cf31b90e88128e4ed7da4548fce","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Balm","description":"Abstraction Layer (but not really) for Blay's multiplatform mods","authors":["BlayTheNinth"],"version":"9.0.6","icon":"C:\\Users\\NukelordBrown\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\4a960af2780943f68bbc55b81a98fcc93159131d.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"balm-fabric-1.20.4-9.0.6.jar"},"mods\\Bookshelf-Fabric-1.20.4-23.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"fe790b41964b4918e7788713ab1ce426354ebd8d6ffad6e41ec2fa3b4c11080cddc1699ffa6e5ac1eb78dd64aa37569775b71adce7a4a3795b8dbe0ce0852afa","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium.

Loader","description":"An open source resource and data loader for Minecraft.","body":"<p>Open Loader is a utility mod that allows data packs and resource packs to be applied globally across all save files in a game instance. This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Reimagining of Better Sprinting built for Fabric and Forge.","body":"**Better Controls** is a reimagining of [Better Sprinting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-sprinting) with even more customizability. It features several new keybindings and many configurable options for how sprinting, sneaking, and flying should behave.\n\nBetter Controls only focuses on complementing vanilla mechanics rather than adding new mechanics (such as [Better Sprinting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-sprinting)'s option to allow sprinting in all directions) that only work on client side and server owners must explicitly opt in to enable them. By not having such features in Better Controls, it significantly reduces complexity by not having a server side version of the mod, and not needing a way to completely disable the mod while the game is running.\n\nAnother major difference is the amount and granularity of options. Better Controls could be considered an *advanced controls mod* - by default, none of the keybinds are bound, and all options are set to match vanilla behavior. To take full advantage, go into *Options - Controls - Better Controls*, check out all of the available options, and figure out the best configuration for you.\n\n## Features\n\nThe mod adds **Toggle Keybinds** for sprinting, sneaking, flying (creative mode), walking, and jumping. You can use modifier keys (Control / Shift / Alt) for each, including for example setting Control to Sneak, and Control + Y to Toggle Sneak. If you press the original key, the toggle will be canceled (in the previous example, you can Toggle Sneak by pressing Control + Y, and stop sneaking by simply tapping Sneak).\n\nYou can also bind a key that resets all **Toggle Keybinds** at once. That makes it easy to for ex. turn on walking, jumping, and sprinting, and then turn all of them off again by pressing one key instead of three.\n\n#### Sprinting\n- **Sprint Key Mode** changes how the Sprint key behaves. You can choose between *Tap To Start Sprinting*, *Tap To Start / Stop Sprinting*, and *Hold To Sprint*.\n- **Double Tap 'Walk Forwards' To Sprint** can be turned off to prevent accidental sprinting.\n- **Resume Sprinting After Hitting Obstacle** automatically presses the Sprint key once you are no longer touching any blocks (helpful when climbing hills, especially if the previous option is enabled).\n\n#### Sneaking\n- **Move Camera Smoothly** lets you disable the smooth movement when sneaking or unsneaking.\n\n#### Flying\n- **Double Tap 'Jump' To Fly** can be turned off to prevent accidental flight toggling.\n- **Disable Flight Inertia** stops you instantly when you stop holding movement keys.\n- **Disable Field Of View Changing** prevents sprinting, potions, and other factors from changing the FOV while flying in creative and spectator mode.\n- **Fly On Ground** lets you fly while touching the ground in creative mode (and also lets you stop flying by tapping Sneak while touching the ground).\n- **Flight Speed Multiplier** (0.25x - 8x) changes how fast you fly in creative and spectator mode.\n- **Vertical Speed Boost** (up to +300%) adds additional vertical speed boost while flying in creative and spectator mode.\n\nBoth speed boosts can be configured separately for sprinting, which will be active when the Sprint key is held. Unlike in vanilla, the sprinting flight boost works in all directions.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe following mod loaders are supported:\n- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) (note: this mod does not require Fabric API)\n- [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)\n\nAfter you install the mod loader of your choice, [download the mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/better-controls/files) and place the **.jar** file into **.minecraft/mods**.\n\n### Minecraft Updates\n\nThe mod will attempt to load on new versions of Minecraft (including snapshots) as they come out. I made it that way so that if the mod works on a newly released version of Minecraft without any changes, I can simply mark it as compatible and you don't have to wait for an update.\n\nWhile this is convenient, there is potential for bugs which can affect server play. If you plan to use the mod on a server, please always use the latest version of the mod, and wait until I either mark the version as compatible with new Minecraft updates, or release a new version of the mod that is marked as compatible.\n\n### Compatibility\n\n- Better Controls is a client-side mod, it will do nothing when installed on a server.\n- If you run into a conflict with another mod that modifies the *Controls* screen, hold Alt while opening *Controls* to prevent Better Controls from adding its button. If another mod prevents the button from appearing, a button to open the mod's configuration is available in the Mods menu (for Fabric, install [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)).\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Options Menu Screenshot](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/images/9fed66f9f60a8d880fba24f5333ed7e11d1a7ae2.png)\n","published":"2023-08-28T17:03:33.441681Z","updated":"2023-12-12T15:09:07.650450Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4487,"followers":33,"categories":["transportation","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rqRuy7UP","KG4EYTdX","zfAWRCmG","iUyy2aqi","zdmOEmpf","RSSArw7m","lC2Y9i2e","Wi7pUNrq","tda10jFt","IB4HufHQ","KmO1TSlL","AMG4PwRi","M1ZrVs3e","OFWnZwQj","ghK2evU3","Lb2x1ms1","87yLEyoC","OvZB9CKY","YCUoRK51","rT0CA9SR","YMqE2EQf","JeVyZvdv","91qx3d1j","pH5QhuW5","dCwhrzEo","EE77WlUh","cBVX5Stt","gmnrHzqp","H9eghR9n","f1SbNU0F","xjumEYGP","fX686AOi","BzSmcOar","7klK53zl"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/d88dcf6b560adfec0437608b153de57e8e9ae15d.png"},"version":{"id":"BzSmcOar","project_id":"ANpj0aBF","author_id":"5m2P2LwC","featured":false,"name":"Release 1.3.0b","version_number":"1.3.0b","changelog":"<p>- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.3</p>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-12T15:08:51.195414Z","downloads":1035,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8019a625938c7c2500315ce56ddf87d3e7462878","sha512":"14073da6e15508a20c187b32b5ff54910d6c46dc3973370e7793e56b825878ec01a00641d66b1f978e94351f171a5fde11d337bb556aa7490f7d1d19248de710"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ANpj0aBF/versions/BzSmcOar/BetterControls-Fabric-1.20.3%2Bv1.3.0b.jar","filename":"BetterControls-Fabric-1.20.3+v1.3.0b.jar","primary":true,"size":93959,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fGdMIZpd","user":{"id":"5m2P2LwC","username":"chylex","name":"","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3685160?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-10T05:31:00.453503Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"BetterControls-Fabric-1.20.3+v1.3.0b.jar"},"mods\\litematica-printer-1.20.4-3.2.1.jar":{"sha512":"a17acf54cfc740c36b653e6fd36030115d7961f7d174cd33e9225de7a1b1d43c578a76b4c08847d5d2c5ff5950ac0e813cd4bf29cda11b0b007d9748af10646f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"3llatzyE","slug":"litematica-printer","project_type":"mod","team":"vbgvRo8i","title":"Litematica Printer","description":"This fork adds the missing printing functionality for Litematica","body":"# Litematica Printer\nLitematica printer is a mod that allows players to build big structures more quickly by automatically placing the correct blocks around you.\n\n![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/printing/printer_demo.gif)\n\n## How To Use\nUsing the printer is straightforward: You can toggle the feature by pressing `CAPS_LOCK` by default. To configure variables such as\nprinting speed and range, open Litematica's settings by pressing `M + C` and navigate to \"Generic\" tab. Printer's configuration can be\nfound at the bottom of the page. You can also rebind the printing toggle under \"Hotkeys\" tab. Holding down `V` by default will also\nprint regardless if the printer is toggled on or off.\n\n### List of blacklisted blocks\nThese blocks have not been implemented yet for various reasons and the printer will skip them instead of placing them wrong. If any\nother blocks are placed incorrectly, try to lower the printing speed. If certain block is still placed incorrectly, you can create\n[an issue](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/issues).\n - Grindstones\n - Skulls placed on the ground\n - Signs\n - Glow lichen and vines\n - Entities, including item frames and armor stands\n\n## Requirements\nThis mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica), and [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib).\n\nFabric-API is available on Modrinth however litematica and malilib are not and must be downloaded through CurseForge or their respective Githubs.\n\n## SERVER USAGE NOTE:\nPlease be aware, using this mod on a server may be against the rules and could get you banned!\n\n## GENERAL PROJECT NOTE:\nI am not a developer of this project, but I have been [given permission](https://github.com/aleksilassila/litematica-printer/issues/113#issuecomment-1212197312) to upload it here and will attempt to keep it updated.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

This mod aims to address the issue of players being randomly muted in 2b2t's chat without being provided with a reason for their mute. With 2b2t IRC, players can enjoy an uncensored chat experience, as long as they refrain from engaging in any illegal activities.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Greentext for messages starting with \">\":** This feature allows users to emphasize or quote their messages using a distinctive green color, just like in 2b2t's chat. It makes messages stand out and adds a touch of familiarity to the chat experience.\n- **Private messaging functionality:** Users can have one-on-one conversations with others privately, ensuring their discussions remain confidential and separate from the public chat.\n- **Ability to block players using \"/ignore\":** This feature empowers users to selectively block and ignore specific players, enhancing their chat experience by reducing unwanted interactions and spam.\n\n\n## Installation\n1. Download and install the latest version of Minecraft Fabric or Quilt.\n2. Download the latest version of the 2b2t IRC mod from [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/2b2t-irc-fabric/version/1.0.3-1.20.1).\n3. Place the downloaded mod file into the \"mods\" folder in your Minecraft installation directory.\n4. Launch Minecraft and enjoy the new uncensored chat experience on 2b2t!\n\n## Usage\nOnce the mod is installed, simply join the 2b2t server as you normally would and type `/irc` to toggle sending messages to IRC. Chat freely and express yourself without the fear of unexpected mutes, as long as you refrain from engaging in any illegal activities.\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and features of 2b2t IRC. If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or would like to contribute code, please open an issue or submit a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/2Builders12Rules/2b2tIRCFabric).\n\nWe hope that 2b2t IRC enhances your chat experience on 2b2t and provides a more transparent and enjoyable communication platform. Happy chatting!\n\n*This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by 2b2t.*\n","published":"2023-08-27T13:17:25.144057Z","updated":"2024-03-19T07:35:52.938393Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":136,"followers":0,"categories":["social"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["7KzSSXzk","TKWuStY2","SjJvyP3A","EJ0G2l4d","rTnD31Di","HRD1dwC0","ZzTkO2Qb"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3Ej1RlKQ/e1cbd54cf7bf782f96be9c387aecbf4292487023.png"},"version":{"id":"ZzTkO2Qb","project_id":"3Ej1RlKQ","author_id":"c1BgiQXR","featured":false,"name":"2b2t IRC Fabric v1.0.4 for MC 1.20.4","version_number":"1.0.4-1.20.4","changelog":"- Fixed a game crash\n- Now shows the last disconnect reason when not connected to IRC\n- /irc command now enables auto-reconnect if it's disabled\n- Fixed kick messages not being shown correctly\n- Sending messages to IRC now gets disabled if you try to send a message while disconnected","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-19T07:35:54.723968Z","downloads":5,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bb2933352ac86eb208e8b0c44dc31d53176c227f49f1d8cdb1c8704836a44bb600211975afdaf527a4a1cf9c27199aac0a0fb18049c1769d48b5cfe61875a8b1","sha1":"030a25a8494b75007574f24b78d4937b3b779bcc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3Ej1RlKQ/versions/ZzTkO2Qb/IRC2b2tFabric-1.0.4-1.20.4.jar","filename":"IRC2b2tFabric-1.0.4-1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":41865,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"05018c618da3e9a0d1f3d73e8c1486446ae99f2c","sha512":"0f917daf1eef164aeb1742c2314479461592e8fa0c7c48d93c91d6169629a4687e51a62bdd63036fb792cb32c0ed5fd771cde89be1dd47ee8f2448112517b4fc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/3Ej1RlKQ/versions/ZzTkO2Qb/IRC2b2tFabric-1.0.4-1.20.4-sources.jar","filename":"IRC2b2tFabric-1.0.4-1.20.4-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":18157,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O3Xxrd0Y","user":{"id":"c1BgiQXR","username":"2b12r","name":"2b12r","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/c1BgiQXR/34dfb906b97659ea584fafbbb91c88d9931c07ae.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-08-27T13:15:02.704583Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"IRC2b2tFabric-1.0.4-1.20.4.jar"},"shaderpacks\\Bliss-Shader-DH.zip":{"sha512":"f961e738db2148097665c8effc5ac25eed5017d8a11340a8adb078c50b23f9005078475e31de9bc0b689129bc95e60b44f64d67213c510d255dfc380daff427f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"unknown"},"file_name":"Bliss-Shader-DH.zip"},"mods\\citresewn-1.1.4-dicedpixels+1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"30c604cfc97b4ba8d7834dd22efd24c96140d7c8a8e45f66991b78c2e20c46553b729a00103c5a67514e54e0fe3da0c0b6ad33a7147059011e44dd910acac349","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"CIT Resewn","description":"Re-implements MCPatcher's CIT","authors":["SHsuperCM"],"version":"1.1.4-dicedpixels+1.20.4","icon":"C:\\Users\\NukelordBrown\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\5c29d94364d6087aa12b45259c80067cdf116c2d.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"citresewn-1.1.4-dicedpixels+1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\carpet-fixes-1.20-1.17.0.jar":{"sha512":"17ad671991ed858d52e350394599c3b5efc5deb2c8962f628917177dad658478371e1e41ded816feaf36804122488b959501342acf9596169a8152c1b5d19065","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"7Jaxgqip","slug":"carpet-fixes","project_type":"mod","team":"XNixVUZa","title":"Carpet-Fixes","description":"The carpet extension to fix all vanilla minecraft bugs","body":"# Carpet-Fixes\n\n[Fabric Carpet](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) extension mod which attempts to fix as many vanilla minecraft bugs as possible!\n\n**Currently has more than 220+ Fixes**\n\n---\n\n### Requires Carpet: [Download](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet/versions)\n  \n---\n\n## Settings\n\nSee [List of all available settings](https://github.com/fxmorin/carpet-fixes/wiki/Available-Settings)\n\n## More detail\nThis mod works for both Singleplayer & Multiplayer, although it only modifies server-side functionality!\nThe mod does fix some client-side bugs (not many), and only if carpet-fixes is on the server as well.\nFor Client-Side fixes, go check out: [blanket](https://github.com/BlanketMC/blanket-client-tweaks)  \n\n## My other optimizations/fixes\n* [MemoryLeakFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix) -

It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

Gap Fix","description":"Fixes gaps in Block Models and Item Models","body":"Model Gap FIX\n\n \n\nThis is a simple client mod that fixes https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-73186\n\nwhich affects both Block Models and Item Models and possibly other models too\n\n \n\nThe mod works by removing texture zooming, making every model face use 100% of its texture, unlike of what it did previoulsly.\n\nThisnot only fixes this bugs on items (where it's most noticeable) but with block models too and everything else that might use those functions.\n\n \n\nThis issue was especially noticeable with custom block models or some 2d items.\n\n \n\n \n\nQ&A:\n\n- Will this slow down my game? \n\nNot at all! Removing texture zooming just removes some code and has no impact. If you however want to be nit picky the mod also slightly tweaks item models in a way that could add a ouple more quads for concave item textures compared to vanilla so in that case it could very slightly worse that vanilla. This is however negligible and could only be an issue when trying to run high resolution packs\n\n- How does this work?\n\nThe base fix is simply removing texture zooming. This is extremly simple to do and immediately \"fixes up\" all those problematic gaps on models.\nFor 2d item models something else is needed as this alone creates another kind of tiny gaps in them due to the way they are generated, quad by quad. These are very tiny and they flicker so I had to fix those too. To do so I've changed the item model generator to never create a quad that encompasses a transparent pixel and instead create multiple quads for each row of solid pixel in the same direction. This allows me to slightly increase the size of all these side quads without creating new gaps in the process, thus covering all gaps seamlessly. Note that this last part only applies to forge as fabric does not seem to have such tiny lines and the models work right away with no extra quad\n\n ","published":"2022-09-13T21:58:16.905418Z","updated":"2024-03-21T17:21:40.224008Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1079552,"followers":1036,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["aZZZrtpR","vJ00juj2","7ainrOrH","EglYgeMq","Kfbnfh5q","i0mERlxq","ZvRvG9JE","r6uVoUxU","fbaUxdx3","BEeRgTMS","kST7zzvZ","GkLb4bRl","og4A1nN8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/5a8203e120985d11616614e11ad7b888997000d8.png"},"version":{"id":"r6uVoUxU","project_id":"QdG47OkI","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"1.14","version_number":"1.14","changelog":"1.20 fix. works for me","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-24T14:44:16.042293Z","downloads":788949,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"892fcccb853e097c3bc11b7205ccd7e99432a6eefee0a6803432d2aa91411eaf0ade9efbd301f5b6991e9efa265cacf67f67518181c3bd2e1ab178e76a4b18c9","sha1":"7c6a38565820d9c1941eb9d1aadaae75cb11ed8b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QdG47OkI/versions/r6uVoUxU/modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","filename":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":65430,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nq0CQj6q","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"modelfix-1.14-fabric.jar"},"mods\\fullstackwatchdog-1.0.1+1.19.2-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"aca5e11958e07e6da38fdbe044a9a5d0f2e976c8bd390dcfec91ba6f92b1ef2d801f98bb744f76d589e3f464dbc61d4181037453ee3d9b655df1fd15d240cf22","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"oZiSDGCi","slug":"fullstack-watchdog","project_type":"mod","team":"u2bVXiuF","title":"FullStack Watchdog","description":"Make Watchdog crashes show all the code that was running for all threads","body":"This is a tiny **server-sided** mod that makes it so that the logs show more information when the Watchdog system on the server has killed the server due to being deadlocked or stuck so long. The crash report log will now show all of the code that was running at the time of the deadlocked server. In other words, the full stacktrace of all threads instead of the normally truncated (shortened) version.\n\n \n\nIn theory, this should help with diagnosing what modded code or mixin has caused an \"off-thread\" to lock up. When a thread locks up, the server thread gets stuck and if it remains stuck for so long, the Watchdog kills it because a tick took too long to complete. **It won't help solve all deadlock issues.** But it might get you just enough info to track down the cause of a few deadlocks.\n\nImage below is an example of before and after this mod is put on **(Gallery tab shows image better)**: \n![Example of improvement](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/oZiSDGCi/images/41969c24917aacdc6741bb68413cb3b81acaa2a2.png)\n\n \n\n**Yes you may ship this mod in a modpack.** The client can also have this mod on but it won't do anything on client since the Watchdog system is only ran on servers.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-02-12T22:46:13.376542Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2235571,"followers":2123,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"StXMrAsz","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.3.2+1.20.4 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.3.2+1.20.4-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib v3.3.2 for 1.20.4\n\n- Hook into the resource reloader to preload any webp/gif files that are used.\n  This should make loading images when opening GUIs appear instantaneous.\n- Fix issue where buttons got stuck and appeared as though nothing had saved.\n- Fix an issue on NeoForged where the access widener was not transformed to an access transformer.\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-19T17:18:48.914116Z","downloads":269892,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9cbb8f3401160ec4422630bbf930208a898fe320","sha512":"597073b3835ce1d4c0f9e4ba835bd565871fa49a8feee41b90213480a76d251e2a57a71729f132e4b908ef50a5602cff90c330da229db605014e26e856cfcbc8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/versions/StXMrAsz/yet-another-config-lib-fabric-3.3.2%2B1.20.4.jar","filename":"yet-another-config-lib-fabric-3.3.2+1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":979275,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Nwpe87D0","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":"isXander","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"yet-another-config-lib-fabric-3.3.2+1.20.4.jar"},"shaderpacks\\CTMPOMFIX 1.7.6d ( IRIS ONLY DH TEST - READ CHANGE LOG) (Chocapic13' Shaders edit).zip":{"sha512":"1bb667421f58ff9c5fd9995af13ca8a44f9614f58b5816ec4de994d05832542cb561172d1929a6bbca7988b7f6e76ef8cc72cac6eacca46d3bdc89ba6de5f685","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"unknown"},"file_name":"CTMPOMFIX 1.7.6d ( IRIS ONLY DH TEST - READ CHANGE LOG) (Chocapic13' Shaders edit).zip"},"mods\\jpgscreenshot-1.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"69c6d18da0e702158a357152e82cf74684b9f203ff015158b7bab310500e18187e0fb280b8844512048873d93e2740b375d46b2c667e64961df1da854785663e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2U2SPYe3","slug":"jpgscreenshot","project_type":"mod","team":"S3ww4MTK","title":"JPG Screenshot","description":"Saves screenshots as JPG files","body":"#### With this mod:\n\n- **F2** saves screenshots as .jpg\n- **ALT+F2** saves screenshots normally as .png (modifier key is configurable)\n\nWorks on any version past 1.17.

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-12-20T22:19:09.571967Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":4210559,"followers":8619,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"nMhjKWVE","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.12.1","version_number":"mc1.20.4-0.12.1","changelog":"Lithium 0.12.1 is the first release for 1.20.4.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options at [description of all optimizations here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.4-0.12.1/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/compare/mc1.20.2-0.12.0...mc1.20.4-0.12.1\n\n## Additions\n- Very experimental item entity optimizations (disabled by default for now)\n- Caching of block class analysis, reducing startup times","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-20T22:19:35.442632Z","downloads":499076,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"70bea154eaafb2e4b5cb755cdb12c55d50f9296ab4c2855399da548f72d6d24c0a9f77e3da2b2ea5f47fa91d1258df4d08c6c6f24a25da887ed71cea93502508","sha1":"4a0744beb2246d93cb475d21a5a53faa556956e0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/nMhjKWVE/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.4-0.12.1.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.4-0.12.1.jar","primary":true,"size":716022,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":"2No2Name","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1363084?v=4","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.4-0.12.1.jar"},"mods\\itemscroller-fabric-1.20.4-0.22.0.jar":{"sha512":"dc69f6b3ab240c965203ddce4d1df001a008d6e4fbe273b192fcdff81dea5529025b5234a056b010fe68a4bb51d1283b67960c64c86379a55932f07930fb8661","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"inferred","title":"Item Scroller","description":"Move items in inventory GUIs by scrolling the mouse wheel or dragging over slots","authors":["masa"],"version":"0.22.0","icon":"C:\\Users\\NukelordBrown\\AppData\\Roaming\\com.modrinth.theseus\\caches\\icons\\2e5093c850d539b8126a7b123efbfff3cbbcc316.png","project_type":"mod"},"file_name":"itemscroller-fabric-1.20.4-0.22.0.jar"},"mods\\ExtremeSoundMuffler-3.45.1-fabric-1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"f67aa0e821bbef9405485411071b29541794234cc38b2577c4f497f70055de96917992b9010c3662bd94e9fb951bec0f22b739a42df25deea165dcbd7ec6294c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5IIKsxiL","slug":"extreme_sound_muffler","project_type":"mod","team":"EWpnVYOK","title":"Extreme sound muffler","description":"Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively.","body":"<h1><center> Extreme sound muffler</center></h1>\n<br/>\n<h3><center> Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively. </center></h3> \n<br/>\n<h6><center><b>Now with Dark mode!!

Click on the button in your inventory or assign a key to open the gui.\n\n    2. Click on the button next to the sound you want to muffle.\n\n    3.  Optional: set the volume of the sound dragging the slider around.\n\n    4. Optional: press the play button to be sure that's the sound you want to muffle.\n\n    5. Enjoy peace.\n\n## What about Anchors?\n#### Anchors are ranged mufflers, for when you want to muffle a sound on a small area.\n\n    1. Open your ESM Screen\n\n    2. Select one of the 10 numbered buttons\n\n    3. Press the marker like button on the right panel to set the Anchor position\n\n    4. Optional: press the edit Anchor button (next to marker) and set the name and range of the Anchor\n\n    5. Muffle the sounds and enjoy ranged peace\n\n#### You can change the Anchor position whenever you want by pressing the marker button.\n\n## Inventory button\n\n#### if you don't like the ESM muffler in the inventory, you can disable it in the config. \n#### if you don't like the position of the button, you can hold right mouse button over the muffler button and drag it wherever you want.\n\n## Most things are configurable! like:\n\n - You can put the muffle and play buttons on the left right of the screen for easier visuals.\n - You can disable the anchors.\n - You can blacklist sounds to prevent them to appear in the ESM screen.\n - You can choose the default muffle volume.\n - You can disable the Inventory button\n\n<a href=

For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds and practice good game modding skills.\n\n## Support\nOur issue tracker: [link](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric/issues)  \nOur discord server: [link](https://discord.gg/Kdy8NM5HW4)\n\n## Development builds\n**Note: Development builds may modify the config files in a way unreadable by previous versions.

[Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v20.4.3-1.20.4] - 2024-01-22\n### Fixed\n- Fix `mods.toml` entries for NeoForge\n\n## [v20.4.2-1.20.4] - 2024-01-13\n### Changed\n- Implement `UnmodifiableConfigWrapper` for `IConfigSpec` adapters on NeoForge & Forge\n\n## [v20.4.1-1.20.4] - 2024-01-10\n- Huge internal restructure, including new publications for NeoForge (for using Forge configs) and Forge (for using NeoForge configs)\n- The Fabric publication still includes all classes for both config systems, the api package has been split from `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.api.config` into `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.forge` and `fuzs.forgeconfigapiport.fabric.api.neoforge`\n- The common module is no longer published as `forgeconfigapiport-common`, instead there are now two common publications which are `forgeconfigapiport-common-forgeapi` and `forgeconfigapiport-common-neoforgeapi`\n### Added\n- Added `disableConfigWatcher` config option to both `ForgeConfigSpec` and `ModConfigSpec`\n### Changed\n- Updated ForgeConfigSpec with changes from [MinecraftForge#9810](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/9810)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `FileWatcher` hanging due to an invalid path when unloading server configs\n\n## [v20.4.0-1.20.4] - 2023-12-21\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.20.4 (thanks to [Girafi](https://github.com/GirafiStudios) for helping out!)\n- The mod version now is more streamlined by including the targeted Minecraft version (e.g. Minecraft 1.20.4 -> Mod Version 20.4.X)\n\n[Keep a Changelog]:

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-03-24T17:39:00.454764Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3859843,"followers":4451,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"7JR5qJ8f","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.4-1.20.4 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.4-1.20.4","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Fix culling when the camera is stuck in a wall.

Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting.**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting system on client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will remain effective on client side only if given server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of my mod, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n \n## Installation and Use:\n\nThis mod supports both Forge and Fabric, just download the version for respective modloader. It can be installed on either client, server, or both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present at:\n\n**1. Only Client:** Client will refuse to send account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof they were actually sent from your account. Server will relay them unless `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to true in server options (which it is by default since 1.19.1), in which case you will not be able to join, unless you agree to send signed messages (the mod will supply warning screen);\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable player to system message conversion in config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signature will be stripped on client side before sending messages to server, server will make no attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough the mod can function when present on only one of the sides, it can be configured to demand itself to be installed on another side in order to play. This way you can install it on server and require all clients that join to have this mod in order to have full functionality, but can also leave it server-only if you prefer. Configuration files are located in <u>NoChatReports</u> subfolder of default config folder.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on client, this mod will disable telemetry (similarly to how [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make Velocity compatible with this mod, set `force-key-authentication = false` in `velocity.toml`. Thanks to [MrMelon54](https://github.com/MrMelon54) for pointing this out.\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to chat encryption, you can watch it to learn how to use it (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make No Chat Reports on client recognize servers with your software as safe. I wrote [a small article about this](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status). For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2231913,"followers":3436,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

schematics and their placements can be easily shared.\n\n### Notice Please use with caution\n\nSyncmatica is a mod that gives its users a lot of power and can have consequences for the server. Only use this mod if\nyou feel confident that your users won't abuse it too heavily.\n\n### Credits\n\nOrginal mod made by [nnnik](https://github.com/nnnik)<br>\n1.20 port by [kpzip](https://github.com/kpzip)<br>\n<br>\nLicensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0\n\n## Setup\n\nSyncmatica is a mod for both Minecraft client and server. It is required on the server side for the mod to function at all, and it is also required for any clients that want to use it. (People without it on their client will still be able to play on servers that use Syncmatica, however said people will not be able to use Syncmatica)\nThe is made for Minecraft 1.16+. It's made for [Minecraft Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/). It depends\non [litematica and malilib](https://masa.dy.fi/mcmods/client_mods/), so make sure to have those installed. Please make sure to\nuse the most recent versions of these mods :)\n\n### Client\n\nFirst install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [MaLiLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/malilib/files), and [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica/files). Then place the Syncmatica mod file that matches your Minecraft version in your mods folder. Now you should be able to use Syncmatica on any server that already has it installed.\n\n### Server\n\nFor the server, you only need to install [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and put the Syncmatica version of your choice in the mods folder, and you are good to go.\n\nAfter running the mod once it will create a configuration file that you can use to configure the mod as you please.\nSee [Config Documentation](https://github.com/kpzip/syncmatica/blob/1.19.1/CONFIG.md) for more information.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce installed on your client, you can join every server normally. For servers which have Syncmatica installed you will\nget access to a few extra buttons. 2 of them are in the main menu and allow you to see the placements that are shared on\nthe server and download them. Another is in your schematic placement overview and allows you to share your own\nlitematics with the server.\n\nYou need to be in the same dimension as a syncmatic to load it.\n\nTo modify a placement just unlock a placement on your client. Lock it again after making changes to share the changes\nwith everyone.\n\n## Contact\n\nFeel free to join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6NPDVNMZ3T) for more information and help on the mod.","published":"2022-08-01T18:52:19.949321Z","updated":"2023-10-26T17:51:00.811883Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":51987,"followers":152,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["ZJm4UbPV","8kQVaVYx","a9hccqwJ","Hd3m7tpx","puXZgSxL","kItD1b77","8pHbMo1q","RJF6VfCP","GivVRSry","YCpraFCt","Huy3lywQ","F75W7HML","rlNTRr2e","chakoRye","A0FWRrWP","4GaJKJoH","JxB3gBzc","MQ7NrqXP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bfneejKo/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"MQ7NrqXP","project_id":"bfneejKo","author_id":"UcDRLO3n","featured":false,"name":"Syncmatica

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3237068,"followers":4682,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"pguEMpy9","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":true,"name":"6.0.3 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.3-fabric","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-13T09:52:24.527613Z","downloads":408159,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"709ab6362dd1dcc432edd1e6c33aafba6f2d12be701bc14911107340f8ac2466779c4e57d8a303f0350c46478f23008e6eeca78e4eadedd0bdee63d4ae72ed9a","sha1":"f2bbb773f4213d36201b76820f206e2a6f213c0c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/pguEMpy9/ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar"},"mods\\PresenceFootsteps-1.11.2.jar":{"sha512":"40e406162b7d8289b6b27791697e0ce374d80c8b3c099d60a15de925badc2399cfc19291b37c45399d848d1eacb89d5aa7b747ec99e56090ad9a1b468609c3b1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rcTfTZr3","slug":"presence-footsteps","project_type":"mod","team":"GvrerX1T","title":"Presence Footsteps","description":"..An Overly complicated Sound Mod...","body":"# Presence-Footsteps\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Kirin/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps)](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/latest)\n![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps)\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-fabric-orange.svg)\n\n_..An Overly complicated Sound Mod..._\n\n---\n\nThis is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft. All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2024-03-09T19:49:32.413304Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1475605,"followers":2316,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.16.1","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b"],"loaders":["fabric","liteloader","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF","giebTOyU","teGodXxG","Vt7ls0pO","3JQQCViD","douonZQK","WswrXhsm","LIWEWgbC","KAmTaDGR","EvZkNyaK","ji7wRvVK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ji7wRvVK","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.11.2","version_number":"1.11.2","changelog":"[Changelog](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.11.2)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-09T19:49:33.188414Z","downloads":20844,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0e8b688dd319b76cb714b5028deb4b1b9893f8c9","sha512":"40e406162b7d8289b6b27791697e0ce374d80c8b3c099d60a15de925badc2399cfc19291b37c45399d848d1eacb89d5aa7b747ec99e56090ad9a1b468609c3b1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/ji7wRvVK/PresenceFootsteps-1.11.2.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":7322791,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"JBjInUXM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"­Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"­","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.11.2.jar"},"mods\\horse-stats-vanilla-4.3.0.jar.disabled":{"sha512":"dda2005205318683a32ba6e39ae2de7561c48746803e2a6ffe89bf31112b8c96666237a6937e6343c45844b5fbaa93e2a4873c382b73494cc0d1ffbb6e7e8210","disabled":true,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"l4qoXLzx","slug":"horsestatsvanilla","project_type":"mod","team":"yveQUaa4","title":"Horse

It is _not_ required to be installed on both sides.\nIf you have Starlight on the server, clients can use Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight to connect. Likewise, if you have Starlight on \nthe client, you can connect to Vanilla/Phosphor/Starlight servers.\n\nStarlight cannot be installed _with_ Phosphor, they are completely incompatible. \nBrowsing through [Starlight's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/issues \"Starlight's Issue Tracker\") will show\nfurther mod incompatibilities. Starlight is a rather destructive light engine rewrite, so it should be \nexpected to break mods more often.\n\nPurpose\n------------------\nStarlight was developed for higher scale dedicated servers, as they suffered performance problems due to how ungodly slow the\nlight engine was. The only solution was to create an extremely invasive mod which rewrote the entire light engine.\nI ported the mod to fabric so that I can update it during snapshots, and decided that publishing it for \nall users, especially client users, would be beneficial. However, it does have the downside of being an invasive mod:\nBeing invasive didn't affect higher scale servers because they run on Bukkit.\n\nFurther reading on the technical details of how Starlight achieves its performance \ncan be read here: [TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md](https://github.com/PaperMC/Starlight/blob/fabric/TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md \"TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md\")\n\nPerformance for 1.20:\n------------------\nHere are a few graphs showing performance in 2 areas on: Block editing at high y-levels, and normal block light updates:\n\n~~Light engine time chunk generation Graph~~ has been removed as a benchmark as it is invalid for 1.20.

[FancyMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/fancymenu)\n\n### Fabric\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About \n\nThe audio extension for FancyMenu allows you to add audio elements to your layouts!\n\nAudio elements are highly customizable and have some very nice features:\n- Add multiple sounds per audio element, to let them play as playlist\n- Use the index of sounds in an audio element to change their order or set the same index to multiple sounds to let them play in random order/shuffle mode\n- Set the MC audio channel of audio elements (master, music, etc.)\n- Set the base volume of sounds in audio elements, to adjust sound volumes individually\n- Set audio elements to loop\n- Let audio elements only play once per session\n- Toggle-mute a specific audio element by using the 'toggle_mute_audio' button action\n\nTo use this extension, just install it along with FancyMenu and you're ready to vibe!\n\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu-Audio-Extension) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UzmeWkD)!\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can freely use this mod in

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 1000 cows in a 3x3 box on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 16 FPS                  | 60 FPS               | 3.75x       |\n| Sodium          | 21 FPS                  | 82 FPS               | 3.90x       |\n| Iris and Sodium | 60 FPS                  | 76 FPS               | 1.27x       |\n\n### Map Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **5x higher** when there are many maps on screen. [Tested using IF 1.1.1 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a fabric server with the [Image2Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/image2map) mod and around 930 maps on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 50 FPS                  | 310 FPS              | 6.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 47 FPS                  | 320 FPS              | 6.81x       |\n\n### HUD Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **40% higher** in almost all scenarios. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with different HUD elements on screen (Scoreboard, Potion effect overlay, Bossbars, Filled Chat, Extra hearts, Full Hotbar)._\n\n| Other mods          | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None                | 250 FPS                 | 380 FPS              | 1.52x       |\n| Sodium              | 335 FPS                 | 630 FPS              | 1.88x       |\n| Exordium and Sodium | 740 FPS                 | 840 FPS              | 1.14x       |\n\n### Text Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** when there are many signs or holograms around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 200 signs (Filled with text) on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 70 FPS                  | 125 FPS              | 1.79x       |\n| Sodium          | 110 FPS                 | 300 FPS              | 2.73x       |\n\n### Block-Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **20% higher** when there are many block entities around you. [Tested using IF 1.1.7 on 1.19.3]\n\n_Tested on a spigot server with 400 chests on screen._\n\n| Other mods      | Without ImmediatelyFast | With ImmediatelyFast | Improvement |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n| None            | 170 FPS                 | 205 FPS              | 1.20x       |\n| Sodium          | 315 FPS                 | 410 FPS              | 1.30x       |\n\n## Compatibility\nImmediatelyFast is structured to interfere with mods as little as possible.\nIt should work fine with most if not all mods and modpacks.\n\nKnown incompatibilities:\n\n- OptiFabric / OptiFine\n\nIf you encounter any issues, please report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/issues).\n\n## Developer API\nYou can read the latest version of the API docs [here](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ImmediatelyFast/blob/1.20/API_DOCS.md).\n\n## Partners\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools\nfor monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com)\n\n---\n\nKinetic Hosting offers extremely affordable deals on servers with very good hardware!
