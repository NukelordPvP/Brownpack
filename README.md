## Important: How to Create a New Brownpack Instance
1. Run Brownpack-Export.jar and Brownpack-Export-Symlink.jar (e.g., `/Brownpack/Brownpack-Export`).
2. Compare your export to the example images export.
3. After generating `/Brownpack/Brownpack-Export/Brownpack-Local-Symlink-Export`, copy the files to a new Minecraft instance called `/Brownpack-Alt-0/`.
4. Follow the steps below to create the symlink folders and files then paste them into `/Brownpack-Alt-0/`. You can create as many instances as you want (e.g., `/Brownpack-Alt-1/`).
